"""
	Everything above can be done however you want.
	What's important is that you get a stream of 
	uniformly sampled and cut waveforms and each trace
	tr in st has: tr.stats.coordinates.latitude
	              tr.stats.coordinates.longitude
	see utils.add_latlon() to see how I do this
	using Obspy's AttribDict

	In this example 'st' are non-envelope traces
	instrument-corrected into displacement, and
	'env' are the envelope form of those traces.
	You only need 'env' ('st' is optional'), but
	providing 'st' as well allows for a reduced
	displacement to be returned with each location

	Envelopes are typically downsampled to 1-5 sps
	and smoothed at 5-10 seconds.

# NOTE:		The interaction part has only been lightly tested. Expect bugs with the UI here.
